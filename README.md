# 📜 Description

❗ This repo contains the neural network model for classifying pond aquaculture into 3 types: intensive, extensive, and abandoned.

This project is developed under a [CCAI 2022 grant for scaling out Climate Smart Shrimp in Indonesia and the Philippines](https://www.climatechange.ai/blog/2022-06-16-grants-mangrove).

# ⚙️ Local Setup for Development

This repo assumes the use of [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for simplicity in installing GDAL.


## Requirements

1. Python 3.9
2. make
3. conda


## 🐍 One-time Set-up
Run this the very first time you are setting-up the project on a machine to set-up a local Python environment for this project.

1. Install [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for your environment if you don't have it yet.
```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
```

2. Create a local conda env and activate it. This will create a conda env folder in your project directory.
```
make conda-env
conda activate aquafarm-segmentation
```

3. Run the one-time set-up make command.
```
make setup
```

## 📦 Dependencies

Over the course of development, you will likely introduce new library dependencies. This repo uses [pip-tools](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools) to manage the python dependencies.

There are two main files involved:
* `requirements.in` - contains high level requirements; this is what we should edit when adding/removing libraries
* `requirements.txt` - contains exact list of python libraries (including depdenencies of the main libraries) your environment needs to follow to run the repo code; compiled from `requirements.in`


When you add new python libs, please do the ff:

1. Add the library to the `requirements.in` file. You may optionally pin the version if you need a particular version of the library.

2. Run `make requirements` to compile a new version of the `requirements.txt` file and update your python env.

3. Commit both the `requirements.in` and `requirements.txt` files so other devs can get the updated list of project requirements.

Note: When you are the one updating your python env to follow library changes from other devs (reflected through an updated `requirements.txt` file), simply run `pip-sync requirements.txt`
